# hololive-dash

Hololive is one of the biggest vtuber agency with 40+ active talents.
It's been a year since I knew hololive, thanks to the talents for giving wholesome/funny/cool contents everyday.

> For me, this dashboard project is a challenge to see what I can create within three days.

Before starting this project

- I almost know nothing about Google BigQuery
- Never use Bootstrap

---

#### Final Remarks

What I have done:
- [x] Create/Querying datasets in Google BigQuery
- [X] Access and Query table from BigQuery in Jupyter Notebook
- [X] Getting more familiar with Dash and Dash Bootstrap library
- [X] Getting familiar with Google API, especially Youtube API


> Why deploy it on Heroku, not Google Cloud?
> > When this project started, I'm unable to activate my billing account to access CloudRun service
